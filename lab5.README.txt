Michael Zbytniewski, Lab5.  This lab uses code from my lab 3.  In my lab 3, the light did not properly work.  It turned the
entire shape purple, and this light color can be altered by changing values in the initialization of the light source.  
The shadow mapping for this lab was unsuccessful, despite many attempts.
